# Overview
**1.	Data Sources: Where your raw data originates.**

    ****COVID Data:**** Raw COVID-19 data files, possibly in CSV format, stored in an S3 bucket.
    
    ****Additional Data:**** Other relevant data such as hospital, region, and date information.

    
**2.	Data Ingestion:**

   ****AWS Glue:**** Used for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes. It connects to the data sources, performs transformations, and loads data into Redshift.


**3.	Data Transformation:**

   ****Jupyter Notebook:**** Used to develop and test the ETL scripts. You can use Python with Pandas to transform data and generate the schema.


**4.	Data Storage:**

   ****Amazon Redshift:**** Data warehouse where the transformed data is stored. This includes tables like dim_date, dim_hospital, dim_region, and fact_covid.


**5.	Data Loading:**

   ****Redshift Connector:**** A library used in the Glue job to connect to Redshift and execute SQL commands. It handles schema creation and data loading via SQL commands.


**6.	Data Analysis:**

   ****Amazon Redshift Query Editor:**** Used to run queries on the data stored in Redshift. This includes executing SQL queries to analyze the data and generate insights.


**7.	Visualization:**

   ****BI Tools:**** Tools like Amazon QuickSight or Tableau can be used to create dashboards and visualizations based on the data in Redshift.
